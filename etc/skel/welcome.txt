Welcome to FUZIX

This is the fip FUZIX distro.  A nearly stock 6809 FUZIX kernel
coupled with a lightly modified filesystem tuned to a Radio Shack
Color Computer 3 (CoCo3) environment.  To boot, there are some extra
utilities available and a few bald-faced hacks.

Have fun, and enjoy a true UNIX experience on your crappy 1980's home
computer.
