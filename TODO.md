** TODO

- [ ] man page for cbe
- [ ] man page for bfc
- [ ] install rudimentary forth script for bfc
- [ ] extend CBE to do scripting (syscalls, etc..)
- [ ] scripts !
- [ ] decide on scripting: BASIC, forth, tcl ?
      * BASIC needs some usrn() for syscalling
      * Spiffy forth can syscall, but needs a bunch of words glues.
      * tcl: needs extending to at least do the same: syscalling.
      * no scripting: Just a C program.
- [ ] console menus
      * 'dialog' ? 
      * a BASIC compiler?
- [ ] relearn MS BASIC (yay!)
- [ ] fuzix needs a shutdown command
- [ ] add kernel boot argument to force 40 columns, because life sucks on a T.V. at 80 columns.
- [ ] spiffy - example source code to give to 'bfc' to pop out a clonable forth.
- [ ] increase 'vi' buffer to max, and recompile/install :(
- [ ] install some sort of first-time-boot "etc" files.
- [ ] make custom decb boot disk.
