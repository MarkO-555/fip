notes:

lwwire only talks to stdin/stdout.  This will have to change to some command
line argument tty or something.  a shim like real lwwire is too costly, and
we dont have select() to help us.  

TODO:

* attach to tty
* figure out FUZIX timeouts
* add extensions as static
* actually test on something
