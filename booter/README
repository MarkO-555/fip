This is a(nother) booter for FUZIX coco3 kernel.  It is a standard
DECB application that will grok the FUZIX filesystem and load a kernel
directly therefrom.  The Kernel must be in the standard DECB format,
but will exist on a FUZIX filesystem. This may be incorporated
directly into the FUZIX source at a later date.
